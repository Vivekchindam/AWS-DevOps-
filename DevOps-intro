What we have to use DevOps:
In DevOps, you'll use a variety of tools for version control, containerization, infrastructure automation, monitoring, and CI/CD. Key tools include Git for source code management, Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for container orchestration, Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring, and CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions. 
1. Version Control and Code Repository Management:
Git:
The most common version control system, enabling collaboration and managing code changes.
GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket:
These are popular hosting platforms for Git repositories, offering additional features like issue tracking, collaboration, and CI/CD pipelines. 
2. Containerization and Orchestration:
Docker:
Used to package and run applications in containers, making them portable and consistent across different environments. 
Kubernetes:
Orchestrates and manages Docker containers, automating deployment, scaling, and operation of applications. 
3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Automation:
Terraform, Pulumi, Vagrant: These tools allow you to define and provision infrastructure as code, automating infrastructure management and deployments. 
4. Monitoring and Logging:
Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Datadog, Splunk: These tools help collect, analyze, and visualize metrics and logs, enabling proactive detection and resolution of issues. 
5. Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CI/CD):
Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, CircleCI: These CI/CD pipelines automate the build, test, and deployment process, enabling rapid and reliable software releases. 
6. Other Useful Tools:
Sonatype Nexus: A repository manager for distributing artifacts and containers.
Test Automation Tools: Like Test.ai, for automating testing and ensuring quality.
Configuration Management Tools: Like Chef, for automating configuration and deployment.
